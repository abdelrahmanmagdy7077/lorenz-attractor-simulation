\# The Start of Chaos Theory and a Computational Approach to the Lorenz Attractor



This repository contains the code, data, and manuscript for an independent computational research project exploring Chaos Theory. The primary objective is to mathematically understand and computationally replicate the Lorenz equations, analyzing how sensitive dependence on initial conditions dictates system behavior.



\## Objectives

1\. A summary of how research on atmospheric convection led us to discover chaotic systems and what chaos theory is.

2\. Explaining the Lorenz equations and what they mean.

3\. Building a simulation using Python that generates the popular Lorenz attractor.

4\. Testing different inputs for the parameters to find which invokes the system to exhibit chaos.



\## Repository Structure

To ensure full transparency and reproducibility, this project is structured following open-science standards:

\* `1\_scratchpad/`: Proof of work (messy notes, pen-and-paper math, and scratch code).

\* `2\_src/`: The simulation's core Python scripts.

\* `3\_data/`: Visualizations, graphs, plots, and test results.

\* `4\_manuscript/`: The actual research paper and formatting files.



\## Tools Used

\* Python 3

\* SciPy \& NumPy

\* Matplotlib

\* LaTeX
